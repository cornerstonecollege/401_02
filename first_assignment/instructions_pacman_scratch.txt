- Make sure to create an account first and don't forget to save your project.

- Make a pacman and two monsters
- The pacman should move around the screen using the right, left, up and down keys.
- If a monster touches a pacman, the pacman should die.
- The monsters should move randomly on the screen.

- Basically, all you need to do is surviving for 20 seconds. If you do, you win the game.
